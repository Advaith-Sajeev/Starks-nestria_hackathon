This is the UI Sketch made for our website on the topic - Deepfake Detection 

Where the user when entering our website will signup and login to prove their authenticity and then after re logging in 
they'll be provided with an area to UPLOAD videos and images to be checked if they are deepfakes or not 

When uploaded the next page will show the statistics on the images or videos (Real or Deepfake)
